        BezaCore Labs is a DevOps and AI studio in Petoskey, Michigan. It builds cloud-native software,
        deploys and runs it, and brings AI and automation in where they actually help — for startups,
        small businesses, and teams that need real software shipped and kept running.

                  I&apos;m <strong className="font-semibold text-paper">Joseph Soper</strong>, a software
                  and DevOps engineer in Petoskey, Michigan. I&apos;ve been building software since I was a
                  teenager and never stopped — engineering, infrastructure, and lately AI have been the
                  constant thread through everything else I&apos;ve done. I spent more than a decade in
                  sales along the way, which turned out to be its own kind of asset: it taught me to
                  understand what a business actually needs and to say it plainly. But building is the
                  thing I always came back to.
                </p>
                <p>
                  BezaCore Labs is where all of that comes together. I build cloud-native applications,
                  deploy and run them on solid infrastructure, and bring AI in where it earns its place —
                  and because I&apos;ve lived on the operational side, I care as much about what happens
                  after launch as before it. Durable systems over flashy launches, and one accountable
                  owner from the first commit to production.
                </p>
                <p className="text-paper/90">
                  I try to build the way I&apos;d want someone to build for me: carefully, honestly, and
                  with the long run in mind — using what I&apos;ve been given to make something that lasts,
                  not just to ship and move on.

                Fixed scope, fixed price, written down. Before any work starts we agree on exactly
                what&apos;s included — and what isn&apos;t — so there are no surprises on either side.
                I&apos;d rather quote honestly and deliver than over-promise and scramble. And when
                something ships, it ships with the boring parts done: deployment, monitoring, a runbook, a
                handover. Durable over flashy, every time.
